# Zillow_Home_Value_Prediction
Predicting the log-error between 'Zestimate' and actual home value

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the log error of Zillow’s estimate and the actual sale prices for California for years 2016-2017. According to the National Association of Realtors, more than 5 million units of existing homes were sold in the US in 2020. Home purchase signifies a significant expense for any individual, therefore, a lot of research goes into buying a home. Home price estimates would give the seller and the buyer a reference point, which would thus reduce the time and effort of the people. As a result, a good home price estimate would reduce a lot of unnecessary cost, and would help both the buyers and sellers.

In this project, I use the dataset provided by Zillow for Kaggle, and apply linear regression and gradient boosting to predict the log(error) of Zillow’s estimate. I use the Mean Absolute Error to evaluate the model as it is mathematically easy to define and we can figure out the difference in the price error of the estimate.
